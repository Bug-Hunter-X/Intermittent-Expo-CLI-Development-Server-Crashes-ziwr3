While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly stop responding and show a blank screen or an error message, indicating that the Metro bundler crashed. This occurred without any apparent trigger or error messages in the console.  The application would then require a full restart to resolve the issue. This was inconsistent, sometimes happening frequently and other times working for extended periods without problems.
